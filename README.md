# challenge2
I built this website so employers and developers can access projects I have worked on and connect with me for possible employment and collaboration. They will find links to my projects, an about me section, a contact me section, and a link to my resume.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Motivation
My motivation for completing this is to continue my education and build a page to display my projects, resume, etc... To interface with employers and developers.

### Why
I did this because I believe this is the best way to display my talent and connect with others.
